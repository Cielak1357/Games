C++ Console game
move - wsad
fire - f
In this game you just have to take as much hp from enemies as you can (you have points for doing this). You have only one life.
It was my first game, gameplay here is poor but I rewrote code of this game some time ago so it looks pretty good.

XNA (C#) Shooter
move - arrows
fire - f
In this game you are gaining points from picking up boxes (not from killing enemies). In boxes you have a lot of cool stuff like new weapons, health points or even immortality(for some time of course).
This game is quite cool, but please don't read the code, it's terrible because this game was one of the first projects where I was learning how to write in a readable way.
