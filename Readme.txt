C++ Console game
move - wsad
fire - f
In this game you have to just take as much hp from enemys as you can (you have points from it). You have only one life.
It was my first game, gameplay here is poor but i rewrote code of this game some time ago so it looks pretty good, its very readable.

XNA (C#) Shooter
move - arrows
fire - f
In this game you are gaining points from picking up boxes(not from killing enemys). In boxes you have a lot of cool stuff like new weapons, health points or even immortality(for some time of course).
I think this game is cool, but please do'nt read its code, it's terrible. Trust me. I wanted to rewrote it but i have'nt got enough time.
